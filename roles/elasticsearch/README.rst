Elasticsearch
==============

.. versionadded:: 1.2

This role runs an Elasticsearch cluster via the `Elasticsearch Mesos Framework
<https://github.com/mesos/elasticsearch>`_. 

.. note:: The standalone Elasticsearch role is intended to be used for custom
          Elasticsearch deployments. If you are looking for the full ELK stack
          for collecting and visualizing Mantl logs, you should install the ELK
          addon.

Installation
------------

As of 1.2, Elasticsearch is distributed as an addon for Mantl. After a
successful initial run (from your customized ``sample.yml``), install it with
``ansible-playbook -e @security.yml addons/elasticsearch.yml``. It can take
several minutes for all components to deploy and become healthy.

Accessing User Interfaces
-------------------------

After the Elasticsearch framework has been successfully installed and
initialized, it should be possible to access its user interface directly from
Mantl UI.

Default Configuration
---------------------

The default configuration of the Elasticsearch cluster will require at least 4
worker nodes, each having at least 1 full CPU and 1 GB of memory available to
Mesos. In addition, each worker node will need to have at least 5 GBs of free
disk space.

While a cluster of this size will be sufficient to evaluate and test
Elasticsearch on Mantl, we encourage you to review the configuration variables
below to size the cluster as appropriate for your environment.

Customizing your Installation
-----------------------------

The size of your Elasticsearch cluster is controlled by the variables documented
below. As an example, let's say that you just wanted to stand up a small
Elasticsearch cluster for evaluation purposes. You only want to run a single
node since you are not worried about high availability or data safety in this
scenario. To do this, create a new yaml file (``elasticsearch.yml``, for
example) that looks something like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

  ---
  elasticsearch_ram: 512
  elasticsearch_executor_ram: 512
  elasticsearch_cpu: 0.5
  elasticsearch_executor_cpu: 0.5
  elasticsearch_nodes: 1

In this example, we are configuring both the Elasticsearch framework scheduler
and the Elasticsearch nodes (executors) to each use 512 MB of memory and a half
a CPU each. We are also indicating that we only want a single Elasticsearch node
launched in the cluster.

When you install the Elasticsearch addon, you can tell ansible to use this yaml
file to configure your installation:

.. code-block:: shell

   ansible-playbook -e @security.yml -e @elasticsearch.yml addons/elasticsearch.yml

With this configuration, the Elasticsearch client node will still be deployed
with its default configuration. Of course, you can customize further as needed.

Uninstalling the Elasticsearch addon
------------------------------------

The Elasticsearch addon can be removed by running the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   ansible-playbook -e @security.yml -e 'elasticsearch_uninstall=true' addons/elasticsearch.yml

This will remove the Elasticsearch framework and the Elasticsearch client node
from your cluster. By default, the Elasticsearch data directories will
not be removed. If you do not need to preserve your Elasticsearch data, you can
set the ``elasticsearch_remove_data`` variable to true when you run the
uninstall:

.. code-block:: shell

   ansible-playbook -e @security.yml -e 'elasticsearch_uninstall=true elasticsearch_remove_data=true' addons/elasticsearch.yml

Uninstalling the Elasticsearch Framework (1.0.3)
------------------------------------------------

Uninstalling the Elasticsearch framework involves several steps. Below are
examples of the commands that you can run to completely remove the framework
from your cluster. You will need to adjust the ``creds``, ``url``, and
``control_node`` variables to values that are applicable to your cluster. You
will also need to have the `jq <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`_ utility
installed to follow this example.

.. code-block:: shell

      export creds='admin:password'
      export url=https://mantl-control-01
      export control_node=mantl-control-01

      # remove scheduler from marathon
      curl -sku $creds -XDELETE $url/marathon/v2/apps/elasticsearch

      # find the mesos framework id
      frameworkId=$(curl -sku $creds $url/api/1/frameworks | jq -r '.[] | select(.name == "elasticsearch") | .id')

      # remove the mesos framework
      curl -sku $creds -XDELETE $url/api/1/frameworks/$frameworkId

      # clean up mesos framework state from zookeeper
      ansible $control_node -s -m shell -a 'zookeepercli -servers zookeeper.service.consul -force -c rmr /elasticsearch'

      # delete all elasticsearch data (optional)
      ansible 'role=worker' -s -m shell -a 'rm -rf /data'

   (MB).

   default: 1024

   The JAVA_OPTS value that should be set in the environment.

   default: -Xms1g -Xmx1g

   ``mantl/elasticsearch``, the service name should be ``elasticsearch-mantl``.

   default: "elasticsearch-mantl"
